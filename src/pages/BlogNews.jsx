              In line with our endeavour to feature some phenomenal start-ups for the year 2021, we
              decided to highlight the story of Manson School of Business that has recently dipped
              its feet in the business education industry. For this, we sat down for a freewheeling
              conversation with the Chairperson — Ms. Lavanya Kanduri. This session was quite
              informative and we came back with some food for thought that our readers will find
              inspiring.
            </p>
            <p>
              Ms. Lavanya Kanduri highlighted that the core philosophy of Manson Center of
              Excellence is converting dreams into realistic possibilities. By bringing together
              experienced academicians and corporate trainers, MSB seeks to deliver a high level of
              excellence in BBA, B.Com, and MBA education that prepares scholars for real-world
              leadership challenges.
